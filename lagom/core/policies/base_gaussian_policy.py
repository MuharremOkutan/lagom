class BaseGaussianPolicy(BasePolicy):
    """
    Base class of Gaussian policy (independent) for continuous action space. 
    Action can be sampled from a Normal distribution. 
    
    Note that the user-defined network should return a dictionary
    from its forward function. At least with the key ['mean', 'logvar']. 
    It can also contain the key 'value' for the value function of actor-critic network.
    
    All inherited subclasses should implement the following function
    1. process_network_output(self, network_out)
    2. constraint_action(self, action)
    
    Examples:
    
        env = gym.make('Pendulum-v0')
        env_spec = EnvSpec(GymEnv(env))
