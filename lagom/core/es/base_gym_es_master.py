class BaseGymESMaster(BaseESMaster):
    """
    Base class for master of evolution strategies with OpenAI gym environment.
    
    It is similar to the class, BaseESMaster, the major difference is that
    this class receives a `make_env()` function and pack it with each task
    sending to the workers. Each worker can use it to create an environment. 
    
    For more details about how master class works, please refer
    to the documentation of the class, BaseIterativeMaster. 
    
    All inherited subclasses should implement the following functions:
    1. make_es(self)
    2. _process_es_result(self, result)
